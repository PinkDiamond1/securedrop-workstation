Hi! This is similar to what's going on the in `work` vm.
We're being asked to xdg-open a custom filetype (".sd-xfer-extracted").

This is a tarball of extracted/decrypted submissions from sources.

For now, we just want to accept that tarball and expand it in a nice friendly place (say, ~/Sources/).

This involves registering a new mime type and a new application to handle that mime type. Read the NOTES file in work:~/projects/fpf-sd/ for details on how that's done (hint: it uses the .xml and .desktop files in this directory)

-- ALSO --

We want to open all files in a disp vm. One way to do this is to register an Application with the xdg system which just calls qvm-open-in-dvm, the associating all mime types with that program. The .desktop file in this directory does that. And to associate files, this has worked:

   cat /usr/share/applications/mimeapps.list | sed s/=.*/=open-in-dvm.desktop\;/ > ~/.config/mimeapps.list 

That handles a bunch of mime types, but necessarily isn't complete. As far as I can tell, there's no way to specify a default for "unhandled" types, but will keep looking.

It's probably prudent to remove all /usr/share/application/*desktop files other than the two added from this directory- that way, the user shouldn't be able to open any file (easily) via the file browser. Even more interesting would be to create a very stripped down template for the sd-svs vm which doesn't include any applications able to "open" files.
