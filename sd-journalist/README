move-to-svs.py
  This script should copy any newly downloaded (from SD) content to a fresh dispvm, and arrange for the decrypt-and-move.py script to be run on that content. Unclear if it should leave downloaded content in place, or move it somewhere, or remove it entirely. Probably best to move it?
